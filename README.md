Advanced Electronic Design
==========================

Allowed materials:
* all written documents you want (books, written by yourself, scripts)
* calculater
* NO computers, mobile phones, ...


Kommt:
- Propose a simple schematic for some function (e.g. stabilize reference voltage, a/d, d/a converter)
- Calculate (given an op-amp, supply, e.g. SNR, ...)

Kommt nicht:
- switched capacitor
- internals of op-amp (will maybe come, but is not emphasized much)
